# Introduction

This is a really simple project for supporting float point operations in
Javascript safely.

This package is meant to support currency operations safely. So math operations
like 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 works as expected.

This project is based on https://github.com/scurker/currency.js.

Implementation is different as well as its purpose. But the idea to working with
integers is highly utilized.

# Usage

Check decimals_test.ts code for examples
